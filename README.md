# Objective

The goal is to build a Power BI dashboard that will provide key insights into the 2024 Italian Grand Prix in Formula 1. This dashboard will offer information on:
- Qualifying performances
- Race pace
- Strategy 

It will serve as a comprehensive tool for analyzing the event, highlighting driver performance, tire choices, and key moments throughout the race.

# Data Source

What do we need to make this dashboard?
- Lap Times
- Sectors Times
- Tires chocies
- Positions
- Top Speed info
- Pit Stop Data

The data will be gathered using the [FastF1](https://docs.fastf1.dev/) Python library, which is designed to provide easy access to Formula 1 data, including live timing, telemetry, and lap-by-lap details.
